# Offical repo for "Conversion Rate Prediction via Meta Learning inSmall-Scale Recommendation Scenarios"

Due to the commercial sensitivity of promotions, releasing our datasets is not applicable.

The implementation of our proposed method is based on our company-customized distributed Tensorflow framework for better industrial applications. Releasing code related to the framework is not allowed and detailed information about input features are also confidential. So with these information removed, only part of source code is extracted and simplified as supplementary materials. The released source code is not runnable but able to illustrate the implementation of model structure.
